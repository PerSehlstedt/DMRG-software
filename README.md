This list covers the rapidly expanding DMRG software landscape, comprehensively comparing features of many existing packages. We aim to raise awareness of existing packages and guide researchers in finding a suitable package for their needs while helping developers identify opportunities for collaboration, modularity standardization, and optimization. Despite DMRGâ€™s broad applicability across fields like materials science, quantum chemistry, and quantum computing, many independent implementations have been developed, leading to duplicated efforts and limited interoperability. We highlight key aspects, including parallelism strategies for high-performance computing and symmetry-adapted formulations that enhance efficiency. 

We invite the community to contribute in case of missing software.

## Packages Implementing DMRG 

TODO: Something something packages in alphabetical order.

TODO: Somehow make separate (sub)section/list for the packages that are not compared.

TODO: Make list collapsable (?) Could make each item collapsable (?)

NOTE: How to do with references? Bad for maintainability to have global numbering? Also don't want to take up too much space by having full titles?

NOTE: As a start, probably include the minimum necessary, and if the developers feel like somthing is missing they can add it themself?

Table key:

We closely follow the classification summary and five-level hierarchy of parallelism first introduced by Zhai and Chan [[1]](#references) and then further discussed by Tian and Ma [[2]](#references). The following describes the HPC strategies:

* **Parallel strategies (Parallelism):** Indicates support for the following types of parallelism:
    * **Parallelism within matrix operations (i):** The most fine-grained and lowest-level source of parallelism is the data parallelism found primarily within the matrixâ€“matrix and matrixâ€“vector multiplications that underpin the tensor algebra in the DMRG algorithm.
    * **Parallelism over symmetry sectors (ii):** The block-sparse tensor representations in symmetry-adapted DMRG implementations enable parallelism across symmetry sectors. The calculations on different blocks are independent, allowing them to run simultaneously.
    * **Parallelism over normal and complementary operators (iii):** In ab initio DMRG, the left-right decomposition of the Hamiltonian is expressed as a summation of products of normal and complementary operators. These operators are distributed over threads and processors, processing the corresponding calculations concurrently.
    * **Parallelism over a sum of sub-Hamiltonians (iv):** The Hamiltonian is rewritten as a sum of sub-Hamiltonians such that each term can be manipulated independently. This coarse-grained, high-level parallelism is easily expressed in the MPO formalism and adds little communication overhead.
    * **Parallelism over sites (v):** The DMRG sequentially sweeps back and forth along a path. The path can be partitioned into sections that can be processed simultaneously at the expense of extra communication at the section boundaries. This coarse-grained parallelism is especially useful for large systems with many sites.

* **Mixed-precision (MP):** Indicates support for the recently developed mixed-precision optimization technique introduced by Tian et al., where the initial sweeps are accelerated by using reduced floating-point precision. Later sweeps restore full precision by switching to full floating-point precision.

### Symmetries

Support for various types of symmetries. Note that support for multiple features does not imply that they can be utilized simultaneously.

Table key:

* **The unitary group** $\mathrm{U}(1)$: Indicates support for the unitary group of degree one, which is the most commonly used symmetry. It typically enforces the conservation of particle numbers (total electrons or separate spin counts) and total spin magnetization.
* **Cyclic groups** ($\mathbb{Z}$): Indicates support for either $\mathbb{Z}_2$ or more general $\mathbb{Z}_n$ symmetries. A common usage for $\mathbb{Z}_2$ is to enforce the spin-flip (parity) symmetry in the transverse-field Ising model, where flipping all spins leaves the Hamiltonian unchanged. The more general $\mathbb{Z}_n$ group is common in models with an $n$-fold rotational or cyclic invariance.
* **Special unitary groups** ($\mathrm{SU}$): Indicates support for either $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ or more generally $\mathrm{SU}(n)$. The $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ group is most common and is often applied to preserve the total spin, often referred to as spin $\mathrm{SU}(2)$. An example of $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ is the channel $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ symmetry considered by Weichselbaum.
* **Point groups** ($\mathrm{P}$): Indicates support for abelian point group symmetries $\mathrm{P} \in \{C_1, C_i, C_2, C_s, C_{2h}, D_2, C_{2v}, D_{2h}\}$ with real-valued character tables. They are often used for molecular systems to enforce spatial symmetries.
* **Fermion parity** ($\mathbb{Z}_2^\mathrm{f}$): Indicates support for the fermion parity, which captures the anti-commuting nature of fermionic degrees of freedom. The parity is a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum number that yields an additional sign when exchanging two fermions (each carrying odd parity).

* **Other**: Indicates support for less common symmetries, such as the special orthogonal group $\mathrm{SO}(n)$, the symplectic group $\mathrm{Sp}(2n)$, and Anyonic symmetries. Anyons are particles with non-trivial exchange statistics that are neither fermions nor bosons.

Table key:

* **Eigensolver:** Indicates if the eigensolver is a bespoke implementation or provided by some external dependency. Some packages include both, often implementing their own sparse solver complemented by an external dense solver.
* **Comment:** Short comment regarding the method used, mainly for packages that implement their own eigensolver, as they can be less flexible regarding method changes.
